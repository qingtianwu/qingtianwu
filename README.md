### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Personal Introduction
======
I am Qingtian Wu, a soon-to-be doctoral graduate from [Faculty of Science and Technology](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/), actively seeking a faculty position at a university or higher education institution. My research expertise lies in the fields:
* Computer Vision: object/anomaly/keypoint detection, industrial inspection.
* Intelligent Systems: human-machine interaction, avatar technologies, and intelligent robotics.

Furthermore, I actively keep abreast of the latest developments in AIGC technologies, with a particular interest in LLM, multimodal, and diffusion models.

As I near the completion of my doctoral studies, I am eager to embark on a career in academia where I can contribute my knowledge and skills to both research and teaching in this exciting and rapidly evolving area.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Liming Zhang](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/people/lmzhang/) from University of Macau. I was supervised by [Prof. Zhou Yimin](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zym) and [Prof. Wu Xinyu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wuxinyu)  from [Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](https://www.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) .

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae of Wu Qingtian](../files/resume_wqt.pdf).
